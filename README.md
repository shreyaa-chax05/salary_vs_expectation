# Salary Prediction using Linear Regression

## Project Overview
This project implements a supervised machine learning model using **univariate Linear Regression** to predict salary based on years of professional experience. It demonstrates the end-to-end workflow of a regression problem, following standard data science practices.

## Problem Statement
To model and analyze the linear relationship between years of experience (independent variable) and salary (dependent variable), and use the trained model to make accurate salary predictions.

## Methodology
- Data loading and preprocessing  
- Feature and target variable separation  
- Train–test split for model validation  
- Performance evaluation using regression metrics  
- Visualization of regression line and predictions  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  

## Results
The model successfully learns the linear relationship between experience and salary and provides reliable predictions for unseen data points.

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding linear regression theory and implementation  
- Hands-on experience with scikit-learn  
- Model evaluation and interpretation of results  
- Building reproducible ML projects for real-world use  

## Applications
- Salary estimation systems  
- Beginner-level machine learning demonstrations  
- Regression analysis practice for academic and internship screening
